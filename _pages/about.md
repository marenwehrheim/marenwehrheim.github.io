Hi, Iâ€™m Maren! I'm passionate about understanding how the brain solves cognition and perception. To answer these questions I use artificial intelligence, with the goal of finding principles that can advance both neuroscience and technology.

I'm very interdisciplinary, and started my academic journey in studying International Business Administration during my bachelor, but then moved to computer science in my master. During my PhD with <span style='color:#2397ba'> Matthias Kaschube </span> and <span style='color:#2397ba'> Christian Fiebach </span> I worked on different projects related to computer vision and human cognition. Specifically, I studied individual differences in cognitive abilities and their underlying neural functions, built a pipeline to explain hidden representations in artificial neural networks, and worked on denoising fluorescence microscopy images using denoising diffusion probabilistic models. 

In my current PostDoc with <span style='color:#2397ba'> Kohitij Kar </span> I aim to understand how the prefrontal cortex effects learning and how it interacts with visual regions in the brain. I'm also involved in projects studying the geometric and topological structure of representations in brains and machines across the visual hierarchy and across learning.
