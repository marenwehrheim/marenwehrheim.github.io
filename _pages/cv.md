description: I am a Postdoctoral researcher with a strong interest in <span style='color:#2397ba'> <b> applying deep learning to model cognitive and perceptual processes in the brain </b> </span>. My work focuses on investigating neural functions associated with <span style='color:#2397ba'><b> perceptual and cognitive features </b></span>, how <span style='color:#2397ba'><b> geometric properties </b> </span> of brains and artificial neural networks change along the visual processing hierarchy, and how the <span style='color:#2397ba'><b> prefrontal cortex shapes perception</b></span>. By combining experimental data analysis, geometric measures, and computational modeling, I aim to uncover core organizing principles of brain computation.
