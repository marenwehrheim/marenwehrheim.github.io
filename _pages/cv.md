description: I am a Postdoctoral researcher with a strong interest in <span style='color:#2397ba'> <b> applying deep learning to model cognitive and perceptual processes in the brain </b> </span>. My work focuses on investigating neural functions associated with <span style='color:#2397ba'><b> perceptual and cognitive features </b></span>, how the <span style='color:#2397ba'><b> prefrontal cortex shapes perception</b></span>, and how information is <span style='color:#2397ba'><b> geometrically structured </b> </span> in brains and artificial neural networks. By combining experimental data analysis, geometric measures, and computational modeling, I aim to uncover core organizing principles of brain computation.
